## Va'aurum Eruption of Gold

It is said that long ago, during a volcanic eruption that took place roughly 700 years ago, the mountain buried its previous inhabitants in layers of raw gold. This cataclysmic event was said to have occurred long before the rise of the Dramshire monarchy, and little is known about the civilization that was lost in the tragedy.The very idea of an entire civilization being engulfed by molten gold is both fascinating and terrifying, and it has captured the imaginations of storytellers for generations. It is said that the golden layers can still be found deep within the mountain, and that they serve as a reminder of the power and unpredictability of nature.Despite the lack of concrete information about the lost civilization, many locals have developed their own theories and legends surrounding the mysterious event. Some believe that the civilization was home to a powerful and advanced race of beings, capable of harnessing the raw energy of the planet itself. Others believe that the civilization was cursed by the gods, and that the eruption was a punishment for their hubris and arrogance.Regardless of the truth behind the legend, the story of the buried civilization has become an integral part of the local lore. It serves as a reminder of the fragility of life, and the incredible power of nature to shape and change the wyrld. As visitors gaze up at the imposing mountain and imagine the civilization that was lost within its depths, they can't help but feel a sense of awe and reverence for the forces that govern the wyrld.

## The demise of the Dramshire monarchy

In the year 3691, a major political upheaval occurred in the land of Damabrae when the Dramshire Monarchy was overthrown in a coup led by the people of Alta Moda. For centuries, the monarchy had ruled over the entire land, with Lord Preston Dramshire III and his regime at the helm.However, the monarchy's reign was marked by constant turmoil and conflict, particularly in its dealings with foreign nations. The people of Damabrae had grown increasingly frustrated with their rulers, and eventually, they decided to take matters into their own hands. The overthrow of the monarchy marked a turning point in the history of the region, as a new political system was established.The new system was a pseudo-republic, ostensibly led by corporate oligarchs who wielded power and influence over the people through commercialism and vanity. While the monarchy had been a drab and oppressive regime, the new system was no less corrupt or self-serving. The true leaders of the civilization were those who controlled and managed the resources, and the people continued to be subject to their whims and desires.Despite the disillusionment and cynicism that pervaded the political climate, however, there remained a sense of hope and possibility for the future. The people of Damabrae had demonstrated their capacity for change and resistance, and many hoped that this would lead to a brighter and more equitable future for all. The legacy of the Dramshire Monarchy may have been one of turmoil and oppression, but the overthrow of the regime had opened up new possibilities and opportunities for the people of Damabrae to chart their own course.

## The Republic of Damabrae

The rise of the new government in Damabrae had its roots in the discontent of the citizens of Edinburg who were tired of living under the rule of the Dramshire monarchy. The coup, fueled by anger and frustration, was successful in overthrowing the monarchy and establishing a new form of governance. However, the lack of experience and knowledge of the new leaders left a power vacuum that was quickly filled by the aristocracy of Wystria.The government that emerged from the coup was nothing more than an oligarchy, where the few ruling elites held all the power and made all the decisions. Despite their claim of ruling the entire continent of Damabrae, their influence beyond Alta Moda was negligible, and most cities and towns paid little attention to their posturing.The aristocracy of Wystria spent most of their time engaged in civil bureaucracy, as they tried to establish themselves as a legitimate government that followed the cultural ideologies of "government." This often led to lengthy court hearings and other mundane administrative tasks that did little to improve the lives of the people they ruled over.As time passed, the people of Alta Moda became indoctrinated into this new form of governance, even though its impact on their daily lives was insignificant. The pseudo-republic that emerged from the coup may have brought freedom from the monarchy, but it failed to provide a government that truly served the people.

There, they continued to produce a series of breathtaking performances that left audiences spellbound. Some of their most famous shows included "Woe of the Wyvernian," a tale of tragedy, revenge and dark magic; "Cursed Isle of the Materdom," a spine-tingling horror story that explored the depths of human nature; "Belch like a Bevarian," a hilarious comedy about the misadventures of a group of bumbling peasants; and "Sometimes a Strange Inclination," a deeply moving drama about the complexities of love and desire.Behind these incredible stories was the true mastermind, a man by the name of Wildran Vonhiem. Born into a modest family in Alta Moda's working-class region of Edinsburg, Vonhiem had always possessed a passion for storytelling. He poured his heart and soul into crafting these incredible tales, which brought to life the vivid characters and wyrlds that audiences had never seen before.The legacy of the Damabraen theater group and the incredible talents of Viviana Cuormaise and Wildran Vonhiem have continued to inspire generations of performers and storytellers.

## The Council of Public Safety of Damabrae

The mysterious branch of the republic of Damabrae that operates in stealth to investigate potential dangers and mysteries has been the subject of much speculation and rumor. Despite the lack of concrete information about the department and its members, the spokesmen for the republic have reassured the citizens that "all is in good hands."However, there are many who remain skeptical of this claim, and there is a growing concern that this dubious organization may be engaging in activities that are not in the best interests of the people. Some have even suggested that the department operates outside the law and may be engaging in illegal activities.Despite these concerns, there appears to be little effort to investigate or hold the department accountable. Many citizens seem resigned to the fact that the government operates in secrecy, and there is a general sense of apathy and complacency about the potential dangers that this department may pose.The Wystria Haliford Memorial Meeting Hall is where this mysterious department often holds council. This hall is a grand and imposing building, with a facade of gleaming marble and towering pillars. The interior is no less impressive, with high vaulted ceilings and ornate chandeliers. The hall is often used for official government functions and is considered to be one of the most prestigious venues in the region.Despite its grandeur and importance, however, there is a growing sense of unease and suspicion surrounding the hall and the activities that take place there. Many citizens wonder what secrets and machinations are being plotted behind its imposing walls, and there is a growing sense of distrust and apprehension about the direction that the republic of Damabrae is headed.

## Contemporary Religion of Mara Cuora

Mara Cuora was once a planet with a rich religious tradition based on the deities Ruaria, Sattare, Ramor, Veccharia, Ochialis, Kashanti, Celios, and Amaterum. These gods and goddesses were once highly revered and played a significant role in the daily lives of the people. However, over time, the original teachings and practices have been lost, and what remains is a mere facade of the once-vibrant tradition.

Today, the people of Mara Cuora still pay lip service to the deities, but their worship has become a mere formality, devoid of the deep spiritual meaning it once had. The original temples have fallen into disrepair, and the new ones lack the grandeur and majesty of the ancient structures.The people of Mara Cuora have lost touch with the true essence of their religious tradition, and their faith has become nothing more than a shell of what it once was. The deities are no longer viewed as living, breathing entities, but rather as abstract concepts that hold little relevance in the daily lives of the people.Despite this, some still hold on to the old ways, clinging to the hope that the true teachings and practices of their ancestors will one day be rediscovered and revitalized. Until then, Mara Cuora's religious tradition remains a shadow of its former self, a mere remnant of a once-great legacy.

## Gold Rush (Foundings of Alta Moda)

Roughly 300 years ago, 400 years after the alleged eruptions of Mt. Va'aurum, there is fading knowledge of a gold rush that brought people back to the greater Alta Moda area near the mountain. Civilization began to grow as temporary settlements became more established with the discovery of abundant natural resources. History about this period of time has been obscured by general disinterest in preserving literature, and growing darkness creeping from the mountain. 

The greed of Alta Moda's ruling class was originally established by those families who were successful during the time of the gold rush and have done their best to repress the knowledge of their beginnings. The university in Edinsburg has failed to impart this story to the youth of the beautiful city. As the city grow poor in pocket-book they also grow poor in intellect as the years drag on, and their history slips away.&nbsp;

Kahstiel the faithful was a famous character from this time period, a priest who established his church in what is now known as Edinsburg. The church to the god Veccharia stands today in shambles as the people of Alta Moda neglect the faith that once founded the amazing city. Few pieces of art depicting the saint Kahstiel can still be found, perhaps in the meeting halls of the wealthy, who still have the means of preserving such cultural artifacts.

Although the gold rush took place in the recent past, the people are quick to forget and burry their roots far beneath the mountain. Mt. Va'aurum has a strange effect on people, the shadow of the mountain falling across the city sometimes creates an uneasy atmosphere. Legend has it that the mountain may contain hidden treasure that once gave life to this remarkable location.&nbsp;

## Darkstars

The Darkstars, once a group of Starweavers dedicated to harnessing the celestial magic for the greater good, have succumbed to the allure of dark and forbidden powers.

However, their ideals twisted over time, and they fell into darkness, corrupting the very magic they once revered.

## Order of the starweavers

They acted as advisors to kings and rulers, using their knowledge of celestial events to guide important decisions. They also played a crucial role in the defense of the realm, using their magic to protect against otherworldly threats and dark forces that threatened to invade from beyond the stars.The order maintained a network of observatories and celestial sanctuaries throughout the land, where they conducted their research and communed with the celestial realms. These sanctuaries were often located in remote and secluded areas, away from the distractions of civilization. They were places of tranquility and contemplation, where the Starweavers could attune themselves to the cosmic energies and seek guidance from the celestial beings they revered.Throughout history, the Starweaver Order stood as a symbol of wisdom, enlightenment, and harmony with the cosmos. Their teachings and discoveries were passed down from generation to generation, creating a rich tapestry of celestial knowledge. However, with the passage of time and the changing tides of belief, the Starweavers gradually faded into obscurity. Their order disbanded, and their sanctuaries were abandoned or lost to the ages.Today, the memory of the Starweavers lingers as a distant legend, whispered among those who still hold reverence for the mysteries of the stars. Their ancient texts and artifacts, if discovered, could unlock profound cosmic secrets and reignite the celestial magic that once flowed through their ranks. The legacy of the Starweaver Order serves as a reminder of the infinite wonders that await those who dare to explore the realms beyond.
