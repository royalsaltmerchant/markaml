Many of the villagers follow the goddess Ruaria, but their knowledge of her is similarly limited, with many following traditions passed down by village elders without a true understanding of their significance.The village's dependence on cheese production has made it difficult for them to trade for the things they need.

Sunlight struggles to pierce through the dense canopy above, casting a muted, ethereal glow upon the moss-covered ground. The once vibrant tapestry of wildflowers has wilted and given way to encroaching foliage, obscuring the paths that were once trodden by devoted pilgrims.Where once the sacred tree stood tall and proud, now only its decaying remnants remain, a silent witness to the passage of time.

Here, he meticulously records his insights, revelations, and observations, carefully preserving the wisdom garnered through his deep communion with nature and the spirits that reside within the sacred grove.

The surrounding ambiance is one of tranquility and serenity. The melodies of birdsong and the gentle rustling of leaves serve as a symphony that lulls Alaric into a state of focused meditation. Sunbeams filter through the canopy, casting dappled patterns of light upon the earthen floor, creating a sacred space where time seems to stand still.

Visitors fortunate enough to find their way to Alaric's secluded dwelling are greeted with a gentle demeanor and a profound sense of presence. The hermit's dwelling is not merely a physical structure but a threshold to a realm where the ancient and the present converge, offering seekers of knowledge and spiritual guidance a glimpse into the profound mysteries that lie hidden within Diamant Forest.

Alaric's hut near the sacred grove serves as a beacon, drawing those who yearn for wisdom, guidance, and a deeper connection to the ancestral roots that lie dormant within their souls. It stands as a testament to the enduring power of nature and the transformative potential of solitude, reminding all who enter that true enlightenment can be found in the simplest of dwellings amidst the embrace of the natural world.

## Shadowplane

The Shadowplane is a parallel dimension that exists alongside Mara Cuora, shrouded in perpetual darkness and infused with negative energy. It is a realm of shadows and obscurity, where light is scarce and darkness reigns supreme. The very fabric of reality is twisted and distorted within this plane, reflecting the malevolent nature of its inhabitants.In the Shadowplane, the laws of nature are warped, and the landscape is an eerie and unsettling reflection of Mara Cuora. The terrain is often desolate, with twisted forests, jagged mountains, and barren wastelands stretching as far as the eye can see. The shadows themselves seem to have a life of their own, shifting and swirling with an unsettling presence.Creatures native to the Shadowplane are often twisted and corrupted versions of their counterparts in Mara Cuora. They embody darkness, taking on grotesque forms and possessing dark powers fueled by negative energy. Shadows and other shadowy creatures roam freely, lurking in the darkness and preying upon unsuspecting intruders.Traversing the Shadowplane is a perilous endeavor, as the darkness itself poses a threat. It can drain the life force of those who venture within, sapping their energy and clouding their minds. Travelers must be wary of the shifting landscapes, deceptive illusions, and the ever-present threat of malevolent entities lurking in the shadows.Overall, the Shadowplane is a foreboding and inhospitable realm, a prison for the dark and malevolent forces that seek to escape and wreak havoc upon Mara Cuora. It is a place of constant darkness and danger, a realm where the shadows hold sway and the forces of light are diminished.

## Starweaver observatory of Mt. Va'aurum

Hidden amidst the rugged terrain of Mount Va'aurum lies an abandoned Starweaver observatory, a forgotten sanctuary of celestial knowledge. This ancient structure, concealed by the overgrowth of the mountain, holds secrets known only to Dalia.
The observatory stands as a testament to the rich history and mystical practices of the Starweavers, a once-thriving order dedicated to studying the cosmos and harnessing its energies. The abandoned halls and chambers are filled with remnants of arcane instruments, celestial charts, and weathered manuscripts that detail the movements of the stars and the interplay between the realms.
