# Mycelae
is a planetary cluster system that revolves around a single star, known as the
"Cragstar". The Mycelae cluster is home to several planets and moons which are
interconnected through a webbing of unknown galactic energy fields. There are
about seven known planets which inhabit this cluster and may contain life. The
planet we are concerned with for our adventures at this time is known to its
inhabitants as
Mara Cuora. or Ocean Heart. You will find large ocean bodies and various continents
spread throughout as well as towering mountains and deep underground valleys.

Mara Cuora
is home to a people who have lost their connection with their past. Records of
history still rot in caves undiscovered, and those who live nearby show little
interest. Ironically the soul of tradition lingers on as the general population
is consumed with their daily rituals and family affairs. The gods only know what
hidden power lies in the ancient records of yore. 

We find our crew still caught
in the anxiety of keeping to the routine of home-life, or heading out for
adventure, as they have yet to discover the bonds that bring them together. Each
of them having received an
unusual letter
bidding them travel to the city of
Alta Moda, in the major continent of
Damabrae
for an afternoon of reckoning a newly uncovered document from beneath mount
Va'aurum, of which few would be brave enough to gaze upon...
