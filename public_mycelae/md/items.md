## Letter from Jorpus Materfeld of Wystria 

To those of great strength and honor in accordance with the ways of their countrymen, may you grace our court with your power and guide our minds with divined wisdom. I pray I write to thee, who remain in good health and safety, as our land of Damabrae shines with the light of spring and the glistening of rain from the heavens. Bring us to victory as we discover the value in our council, as we welcome the attention of a recent discovery which has come into our possession, as we ponder the mysteries beyond our culture. 

In Alta Moda at the Wystria Haliford Memorial Hall, I will be your gentle host. This pleasure will not be unrecognized for its expense and your compensation will be imminent upon arrival. Blessings upon your journey, arrive swiftly within seven days, on Ochi the 12th of Shantos. We shall hold council at early evening. 

- Sincerely Jorpus Matefeld of Wystria

...
The Mind of the Cosmos created from fire and air the seven administrators who regulate Destiny — the seven visible planets and the sun and moons whose orbits encompass the world of the senses. These celestial powers, known by thought alone, are called the gods,and they preside over the world.They are ruled over by the god of destiny, Celios, who transforms everythingaccording to the law of natural growth, creating from the permanentunchanging Reality,a permanently changing world.

The heavenly bodiesare governed by Amaterum,and from them flows into matteran uninterrupted stream of Soul.Matter is like a fertile wombwithin which all things are conceived.All forms shape matterand Soul-Energy ceaselessly changes them — one into another.This process is directed by Amaterumwho infuses each form with Soulin proportion to its standingin the scale of Being.Our planet is the storehouse of all matter, which it donates and, in return,it receives Life from above.

## Orin's Pendant

Orin's pendant comes from the heart of the spirit tree in Diamant forest sacred grove. It is a small, silver pendant that is inlaid with a brilliant blue gemstone that glows softly in the dark. The gemstone is said to contain a small fragment of a powerful celestial artifact, imbuing the pendant with magical properties that aid Orin in his spellcasting.The pendant has the ability to amplify Orin's magical powers, allowing him to cast spells with greater ease and effectiveness. It can also be used to store magical energy, allowing Orin to draw on its power at a later time if needed. However, the pendant's powers are not limitless, and must be recharged periodically.

## The Eye of Shadows 

The Eye of Shadows is a small, unremarkable looking stone that is said to possess immense power. It is said that those who possess the Eye of Shadows gain the ability to see in total darkness, and can even control the shadows themselves. Jorpus obtained the Eye of Shadows through a shady deal with an unknown seller, and keeps it well guarded in his collection.

## The Vessel of Gorgonar

The Vessel of Gorgonar is a beautiful, intricately carved silver chalice that is said to have been crafted by the ancient elven smith Gorgonar. According to legend, the Vessel has the power to bestow immortality on the one who drinks from it. Jorpus obtained the Vessel from a group of traders who claimed to have discovered it in the ruins of an elven city in the deep forest. Despite its alleged power, Jorpus has yet to attempt to use the Vessel, instead choosing to display it as a centerpiece in his collection.

## The Mask of Azurath

The Mask of Azurath is a bizarre, unsettling artifact that Jorpus acquired from a traveling merchant who claimed to have found it in the ruins of an ancient city. The Mask is made of a strange, almost rubbery material that seems to shift and move even when held still. The Mask is shaped like a human face, but with exaggerated features and a permanent expression of agony. According to legend, the Mask was once worn by a powerful sorcerer who used its power to inflict terrible curses on his enemies. Jorpus has kept the Mask locked away in a specially constructed display case, as he fears that its cursed power could have disastrous consequences if unleashed.

## Amulet of Nature's Vigil 

The Amulet of Nature's Vigil is a beautifully crafted pendant, intricately designed with natural elements and imbued with the essence of the forest. Made from a polished piece of enchanted wood found deep within Diamant Forest, the amulet exudes a faint, soothing glow, reminiscent of moonlight filtering through the canopy.
